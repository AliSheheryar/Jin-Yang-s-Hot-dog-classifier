# Jin Yang's Hot doge/ Not Hot doge classifier
## A CNN trained on ImageNet and some custom Hot doge data
A classifier trained on shit ton of data to __determine__ if **Erlich Bachman** is eating a 
hot doge or not.
Dinesh tried to design such a classifier but his code was not good.
Gilfoyle might try to push some unauthorized code, but he busy doing something in erlich's fridge.
This is my attempt to help Jin Yang secure his multi million dollar series A round.

" Code coming out any moment. Waiting for Erlich to return from the woods."
